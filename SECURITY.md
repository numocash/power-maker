# Security Policy

While we do not have an offical bug bounty program, we encourage anyone who finds bugs to report them to us.

## Supported Versions

The Numo smart contract suite is under audit but the following versions are available on Arbitrum Sepolia. Each deployment is non-upgrable and therefore require new deployments per modification.

| Version | Supported           |
| ------- | ------------------  |
| v.0.9    | :white_check_mark: |
| v.1.0     | :x:               |
