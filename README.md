The repository contains the smart contract suite for the Numo protocol. An implementation of a [*replicating market maker*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14769) on the EVM that replicates a power‚Å¥ perpetual without needing oracles or sophisticated market makers.

### What is a power‚Å¥ perpetual? 

It is a novel financial derivative that simplifies the exposure of a call option into a single contract with no expirys. Traders can now enchance their leverage or hedging strategies with a crypto-native, high composable, on-chain convexity instrument. 

## Local development

This project uses [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) as the development framework.

### Dependencies

```bash
forge install
```

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

```bash
npm install create3-factory
```

### Compilation

```bash
forge build
```

### Test

```bash
forge test
```

### Local setup

In order to test third party integrations such as interfaces, it is possible to set up a forked mainnet with several positions open

```bash
sh anvil.sh
```

then, in a separate terminal,

```bash
sh setup.sh
```
