# ðŸ¤– PowerMaker

## Local development

This project uses [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) as the development framework.

### Dependencies

```bash
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
```
To handle high-percision fixed point airithmic, Numo uses the `PRBMath` Library.
```bash
bun add @prb/math
```
You need to add this to your remappings.txt file:

```
@prb/math/=node_modules/@prb/math/
```
For a consistent address across chain deployments, we use `CREATE3`
```bash
npm install create3-factory
```

### Compilation

```bash
forge build
```

### Test

```bash
forge test
```

### Local setup

In order to test third party integrations such as interfaces, it is possible to set up a forked mainnet with several positions open

```bash
sh anvil.sh
```

then, in a separate terminal,

```bash
sh setup.sh
```
